This is my about page. :wave:

I‚Äôm a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, pursuing a Master‚Äôs in Information Science (Fall 2024 cohort). My studies span algorithms, distributed systems, data warehouse design, and multimodal machine learning, equipping me with both a strong theoretical foundation and practical programming skills in Python, Java, Golang and SQL. I‚Äôm currently focusing on data engineering and software development, with a keen interest in building systems that turn complex data into meaningful insights.

Before transitioning into tech, I built my academic foundation in **social sciences and international relations**, where I explored how data and information shape human behavior and global governance. My research was recognized across several leading publications and institutions, including:

- Reprinted in the July 2022 Issue 7 of *Chinese Social Science Digest*

- Excerpted in the full text of  *the International Trade* (Vol.1 in 2023) of Information Center for Science, Renmin University of China;

- Recognized as "Top 10 Best Chinese Papers in Global Governance in 2022" by the *World Economic Yearbook*;
- Included in *the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Yearbook Volume 2023*.

My experience in social research taught me the importance of **data ethics, human-centered systems**, and how technology transforms societies‚Äîa perspective I now bring into my technical work. 

Outside of academics, I‚Äôm passionate about **photography, strength training**, and **gaming**. I co-founded a small photo and video studio, producing creative visuals for companies and individuals. My hobbies‚Äîranging from marathon running to powerlifting (480 kg total)‚Äîremind me that discipline and creativity go hand in hand. üéÆüí™üì∏

Born in **Shandong** and raised in **Shanghai**, I‚Äôve always been drawn to the intersection of technology, culture, and human experience. Now in Austin, I‚Äôm excited to continue growing as a **data-driven engineer with a human touch**‚Äîready to build, learn, and create impact.

In my pursuit of physical fitnessüí™, I've dedicated six years to strength training, focusing on powerlifting. I take pride in my personal record of lifting a whopping 480 kg across the three major lifts: bench press, deadlift, and deep squat. It's not just lifting weights; it's lifting my spirit!![gympho](https://typora-1323668464.cos.ap-hongkong.myqcloud.com/typora/gympho.jpg?imageSlim)

In the academic realm, I look up to scholars like Francis Fukuyama and Thomas Piketty, whose insights into societal structures and economic inequalities have shaped my understanding of the world. I keep a keen eye on global trade governance and the pressing issue of inequality‚öñÔ∏è. These subjects are close to my heart, driving my academic pursuits and shaping my world view.
