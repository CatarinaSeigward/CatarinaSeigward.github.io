Hello there! üòäI'm a vibrant graduate student specializing in International Relations within the sphere of Social Sciences.

However, I've taken a bold step to pivot my career towards human-computer interaction and game development. After the application season concludes, I plan to compose a detailed post to share my journey through this transition. I'm currently deepening my proficiency in Python and Java, with an aspiration to master C#. Additionally, I'm utilizing tools like UE5 and Processing for development, while also harnessing design software such as Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, and Figma. Looking ahead, I'm eager to expand my toolkit, turning my innovative ideas into reality.

Photography is my creative escapeüì∏. I co-founded a small studio where I channel my artistic flair into creating promotional videos and portraits for companies and individuals alike. It's a world where my lens captures stories, one frame at a time.
