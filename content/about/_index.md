This is my about page. :wave:

I am **Kaiwen Lin**, a Data Engineering and AI enthusiast currently pursuing my Master’s in Information Science at **The University of Texas at Austin** (Class of 2026).

I specialize in building scalable data pipelines and intelligent systems. My technical foundation is built on intensive coursework in **Deep Learning, Algorithms, Data Warehousing, and Cloud Computing**, combined with a rigorous analytical background from my past career in research.

Before transitioning into tech, I built my academic foundation in **social sciences and international relations**, where I explored how data and information shape human behavior and global governance. My research was recognized across several leading publications and institutions, including:

- Reprinted in the July 2022 Issue 7 of *Chinese Social Science Digest*

- Excerpted in the full text of  *the International Trade* (Vol.1 in 2023) of Information Center for Science, Renmin University of China;

- Recognized as "Top 10 Best Chinese Papers in Global Governance in 2022" by the *World Economic Yearbook*;
- Included in *the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Yearbook Volume 2023*.

### 📸 Creative & Athletic Pursuits

I believe that technical discipline and creative expression go hand in hand. Beyond the terminal, I wear a few different hats:

- **Freelance Photographer:** I co-founded a photo studio, capturing everything from **corporate conferences** to **graduation portraits**. I enjoy the challenge of finding the perfect frame to tell a story.
- **Fitness & Strength:** During my undergraduate years, I worked as a **part-time fitness coach**. Today, I’ve shifted from marathons (Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian) to **Powerlifting**, with a current **Total of 480 kg** (S/B/D).

Born in **Shandong** and raised in **Shanghai**, I’ve always been drawn to the intersection of technology, culture, and human experience. Now in Austin, I’m excited to continue growing as a **data-driven engineer with a human touch**—ready to build, learn, and create impact.

Since 2018, I've been conquering marathons in Dalian, Beijing, and Shanghai:runner:. But lately, my passion has shifted to strength training, reserving long runs for my cutting phases. ![8542640895e2761fed6df412fc08e66](https://typora-1323668464.cos.ap-hongkong.myqcloud.com/typora/8542640895e2761fed6df412fc08e66.jpg?imageSlim)

In my pursuit of physical fitness💪, I've dedicated six years to strength training, focusing on powerlifting. I take pride in my personal record of lifting a whopping 480 kg across the three major lifts: bench press, deadlift, and deep squat. It's not just lifting weights; it's lifting my spirit!![gympho](https://typora-1323668464.cos.ap-hongkong.myqcloud.com/typora/gympho.jpg?imageSlim)

In the academic realm, I look up to scholars like Francis Fukuyama and Thomas Piketty, whose insights into societal structures and economic inequalities have shaped my understanding of the world. I keep a keen eye on global trade governance and the pressing issue of inequality⚖️. These subjects are close to my heart, driving my academic pursuits and shaping my world view.
