# ACADEMIC ADVENTURE

## Overview

**ACADEMIC ADVENTURE** is a reimagined Pac-Man style game with an academic twist. Drawing inspiration from the complex and rewarding journey of scholarly research, players assume the role of inquisitive academics, navigating through the maze-like world of academia. This web-based, pixelated game is developed on the Processing to bring its unique concept to life.

In **ACADEMIC ADVENTURE**, players embark on a quest for knowledge, collecting points represented by papers, books, money and even hair growth medicine, while evading personified academic challenges. These challenges include the Funding Fiend, symbolizing financial struggles; the Peer Review Phantom, representing the rigorous process of publication; the Methodology Maze Master, embodying experimental and analytical complexities; and the Career Competitor, reflecting professional pressures within academia.

The game incorporates humor and excitement in equal measure. Large Power-Ups in the form of groundbreaking discoveries empower players to temporarily overcome these academic obstacles, turning the tables on these challenges in a satisfying reversal of roles.

## Inspiration

 The game "Academic Adventure" is inspired by the intricate and often challenging journey of academic research, reminiscent of the intellectual pursuits in classic academia-themed novels and films. I've always been fascinated by the blend of challenge and discovery inherent in academic life. Haven't we all, at some point, navigated through the complex maze of scholarly endeavors, facing obstacles like funding issues, publication barriers, and methodological challenges, much like a game? This sparked the idea of transforming these academic pursuits into an engaging game experience.

Drawing from the humor found in the quirks and idiosyncrasies of academic life, "Academic Adventure" infuses a sense of light-heartedness into the serious world of research. It offers players a chance to step into the shoes of a scholar, navigating the maze of academia, collecting knowledge points, and tackling personified academic challenges. This game is an ode to every researcher's journey – a blend of ups and downs, triumphs and challenges, all wrapped up in an entertaining, cartoonish package.

My aim with "Academic Adventure" is to create an enjoyable escape that resonates with anyone who has experienced the academic world, allowing them to relive, albeit in a whimsical and exaggerated manner, the exhilarating quest for knowledge and the thrill of overcoming scholarly obstacles. It's a playful tribute to the academic spirit, inviting players to revisit and realize a whimsical version of their scholarly pursuits.

## Game Design

### Rule Design

Players will take on the role of scholars, navigating through the labyrinth of the academic world. The objective is to collect as many knowledge points as possible while avoiding various academic challenges such as funding constraints, publication barriers, research methodology challenges, and professional competitors. Players need to find the symbol of a significant academic discovery within a set time limit, thereby escaping the academic maze to achieve victory in the game. If the player fails to find the "Great Discovery" within the allotted time or is caught by an academic challenge, the game will end in failure and restart.

The game rules are as follows:

1. **Role-Playing**: Players act as scholars actively seeking knowledge and academic achievements.
2. **Objective**: Collect knowledge points scattered across the game map and find the symbol representing a major discovery.
3. **Avoiding Obstacles**: The game includes various obstacles representing different academic challenges, such as funding constraints and publication barriers. Players need to skillfully evade these challenges.
4. **Time Limit**: Players must complete the task within one minute. Failure to find the "Great Discovery" or getting caught by academic challenges before the countdown ends results in game failure.
5. **Victory**: If a player successfully collects all knowledge points and finds the "Great Discovery," they successfully escape the academic maze, and the game is won.
6. **Failure and Restart**: If caught by an academic challenge or if time runs out, the game restarts.

### Character Design

I designed images of players, NPC and objects used PHOTOSHOP for pixelated drawing.

There are three levels in this game, and player will control the same person of different stages to finish those levels. The three stages are doctoral student, assistant professor, and associate professor. Each stage will have different challenges for the player and a different collection of objectives to accomplish!

## Game Flow

For "Academic Adventure", I envision several exciting additions to enhance gameplay and user engagement. These include:

1. **Interactive Props**: Introducing interactive items such as 'Knowledge Scrolls' and 'Idea Lamps'. Collecting these would grant players bonus points or temporary abilities, like faster movement or temporary invulnerability to challenges.
2. **Distraction Tools**: Implement tools like 'Confusion Papers' or 'Rhetorical Questions' to momentarily distract or pause the academic challenges. These tools give players a strategic advantage to navigate through tougher sections of the game.
3. **Reward System Expansion**: Introduce new titles and achievements like 'Theory Master', 'Research Wizard', or 'Innovation Guru'. These titles are awarded for accomplishing specific tasks, like collecting a certain number of knowledge points or overcoming challenges without getting caught.
4. **Level Diversity**: Adding new levels with themes like 'Archival Adventure', where players navigate through historical documents, or 'Lab Labyrinth', exploring a complex laboratory setting. Each level will have unique challenges and aesthetics.
5. **Character Customization**: Allow players to personalize their scholar character with different outfits, accessories, and tools, enhancing the role-playing aspect of the game.
6. **Educational Aspects**: Incorporate fun facts and trivia related to various academic fields within the game. This could be implemented via interactive elements in the game's environment or as rewards for completing levels.
7. **Multiplayer Mode**: Introduce a cooperative or competitive multiplayer mode, where players can team up to solve challenges or compete to collect the most knowledge points.
8. **Mobile Compatibility**: Expand the game's accessibility by developing a mobile version, allowing players to enjoy "Academic Adventure" on various devices.

## Game Development

I have been using Processing 4.0 as my development tool, and so far, I have written approximately 450 lines of code. I plan to release it through GitHub.

## Future Development

1.I am currently facing a serious bug where objects and ghosts in the game are spawning inside walls, making the game unplayable. I will fix this as soon as possible.

2.I plan to add a time limit feature to simulate the real-life time pressures faced by PhD students and young researchers in their work.
