# ACADEMIC ADVENTURE

## Overview

**ACADEMIC ADVENTURE** is a reimagined Pac-Man style game with an academic twist. Drawing inspiration from the complex and rewarding journey of scholarly research, players assume the role of inquisitive academics, navigating through the maze-like world of academia. This web-based, pixelated game is developed on the Processing to bring its unique concept to life.

In ACADEMIC ADVENTURE, players embark on a quest for knowledge, collecting points represented by papers, books, money and even hair growth medicine, while evading personified academic challenges. These challenges include the Funding Fiend, symbolizing financial struggles; the Peer Review Phantom, representing the rigorous process of publication; the Methodology Maze Master, embodying experimental and analytical complexities; and the Career Competitor, reflecting professional pressures within academia.

The game incorporates humor and excitement in equal measure. Large Power-Ups in the form of groundbreaking discoveries empower players to temporarily overcome these academic obstacles, turning the tables on these challenges in a satisfying reversal of roles.

## Inspiration

 The game "Academic Adventure" is inspired by the intricate and often challenging journey of academic research, reminiscent of the intellectual pursuits in classic academia-themed novels and films. I've always been fascinated by the blend of challenge and discovery inherent in academic life. Haven't we all, at some point, navigated through the complex maze of scholarly endeavors, facing obstacles like funding issues, publication barriers, and methodological challenges, much like a game? This sparked the idea of transforming these academic pursuits into an engaging game experience.

Drawing from the humor found in the quirks and idiosyncrasies of academic life, "Academic Adventure" infuses a sense of light-heartedness into the serious world of research. It offers players a chance to step into the shoes of a scholar, navigating the maze of academia, collecting knowledge points, and tackling personified academic challenges. This game is an ode to every researcher's journey – a blend of ups and downs, triumphs and challenges, all wrapped up in an entertaining, cartoonish package.

My aim with "Academic Adventure" is to create an enjoyable escape that resonates with anyone who has experienced the academic world, allowing them to relive, albeit in a whimsical and exaggerated manner, the exhilarating quest for knowledge and the thrill of overcoming scholarly obstacles. It's a playful tribute to the academic spirit, inviting players to revisit and realize a whimsical version of their scholarly pursuits.

## Game Design

### Rule Design

Players will take on the role of scholars, navigating through the labyrinth of the academic world. The objective is to collect as many knowledge points as possible while avoiding various academic challenges such as fresh student, outstanding peers, journal editors and even stray dogs. Players need to find the symbol of a significant academic discovery, thereby escaping the academic maze to achieve victory in the game. If the player fails to find the items within the allotted time or is caught by an academic challenge, the game will end in failure and restart.

The game rules are as follows:

1. **Role-Playing**: Players act as scholars actively seeking knowledge and academic achievements.
2. **Objective**: Collect knowledge points scattered across the game map, such as papers, books, money and even hair growth medicine, while evading personified academic challenges.
3. **Avoiding Obstacles**: The game includes various obstacles representing different academic challenges, such as fresh student, outstanding peers, journal editors and even stray dogs. They will distract you.
4. **Victory**: If a player successfully collects all items in a level, he'll advance to the next one, where you'll collect more items and evade an increased number of obstacles. There are three levels in total. This design is intended to simulate the academic career of a young scholar.
6. **Failure and Restart**: If caught by an academic challenge, the game restarts.

### Character Design

I designed images of players, NPC and objects used PHOTOSHOP for pixelated drawing.

There are three levels in this game, and player will control the same person of different stages to finish those levels. The three stages are doctoral student, assistant professor, and associate professor. Each stage will have different challenges for the player and a different collection of objectives to accomplish!

## Game Development

I have utilized Processing 4.0 as my development tool and have written around 450 lines of code to date. This code has been made available on [GitHub](https://github.com/CatarinaSeigward/pac-man-academic-version-).

## Future Development

1.I am currently facing a serious bug where objects and ghosts in the game are spawning inside walls, making the game unplayable. I will fix this as soon as possible.

2.I plan to add a time limit feature to simulate the real-life time pressures faced by PhD students and young researchers in their work.
