Overview

Inspiration

As a photography enthusiast myself, I noticed that many people struggle to simultaneously capture a photo and refer to sample images or reference poses when taking pictures. This observation led me to envision the creation of a camera app where individuals can seamlessly share specific location-based photography poses and angles. Users should be able to view these reference visuals directly within the camera interface.

Additionally, I observed that many people embark on solo journeys, and I aimed to address the feelings of solitude that can accompany such adventures. Through this app, individuals can not only access shared photography inspiration but also engage in a community-driven experience. They can share their own captures, receive likes and feedback, fostering a sense of connection and reducing the sense of isolation that can sometimes accompany solo travel.
