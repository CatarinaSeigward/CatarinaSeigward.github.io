I almost chat with Chatgpt every day. I give my idea to it and it help me to generate a whole paragraph. Then I could continue to brainstorm based on what it provide to me. I hold the view that Chatgpt has increased my productivity by more than 3x . He's also been my right hand man in building this personal website! So I would like to share my tips of learning how to use it.

Learning how to effectively prompt LLMs empowers users to communicate more accurately with these advanced AI systems. This skill is crucial for extracting precise and relevant information quickly, minimizing misunderstandings and inefficiencies. In professional settings, this can translate to enhanced productivity and better decision-making, as LLMs can assist in data analysis, content creation, and problem-solving.

Moreover, as educators and learners leverage AI for personalized education, the ability to craft effective prompts becomes pivotal in facilitating tailored and meaningful learning experiences.

I gonna share some materials about how to learn this skill:
